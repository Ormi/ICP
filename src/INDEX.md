This application is based on game Klondike, basicaly it is its copy with every functionality.
Everything was developed on Linux/Windows with QT5.5 toolkit for GUI(Graphical user interface) and
standard input output stream for CLI(Command line interface) version. Game core is independent when
you play CLI or you play a GUI version. Basicaly GUI is just some sort of abstraction based on core
commands. We are very pleased that we could introduce this game and show you
how to make such nice game with help of object oriented programming (OOP).

Everything is made in c++ with some Makefile compilation mechanics. This game
is not OS(Operation system) binded.

__Sumary:__

Overal work on this project
* about 60 hours of coding core things(Also bug fix and testing)
* about 100 hours of coding GUI (Learning QT, building, fixing, changing design, problems with implementations before, make abstraction for some methods and functions).
* about 5 hours of object oriented design.

__Conclusion:__ spend more time on design than on implementation.
